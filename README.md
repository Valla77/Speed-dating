# Speed Dating with Tinder : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project

This project has been presented as part of my **Machine Learning Engineer certificate** for the Jedha Data Fullstack program.

## Company

<a href="https://tinder.com/" target="_blank">Tinder</a> is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests. 

## Project 

 This project involves an in-depth examination of speed dating data amassed by Tinder. The primary objective is to pinpoint the pivotal elements that contribute to the achievement of a successful match.

## Goal

Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together:
* You may use descriptive statistics
* You may use visualisations

## Deliverable

A notebook with:
* descriptive statistics
* visualisations
* captions and interpretations on how the stats and visualisations are relevant to why people agree to a second date
